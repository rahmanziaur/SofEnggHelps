GRE Mock Test

Analytical Writing

Task 1: Analyze an Issue

Prompt: "Some people believe that technology has made the world a better place to live. Others argue that technology has caused more problems than it has solved. Discuss your viewpoint, providing reasons and examples to support your argument."

Task 2: Analyze an Argument

Prompt: "The following appeared in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper:

'In the past year, our town’s recycling rate has declined by 15%. At the same time, the number of new residents moving into the town has increased significantly. Clearly, the new residents are less likely to recycle than long-time residents. Therefore, the town should implement a mandatory recycling program for all residents to improve the recycling rate.'

Discuss how well-reasoned you find this argument. Point out any assumptions, flaws, or gaps in the reasoning and suggest ways to improve it."
